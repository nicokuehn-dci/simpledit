# Text Editor Project Guide

## Concept

A text editor is a software application that enables users to create, modify, and save plain text files. Unlike word processors, text editors focus on handling plain text without formatting.

## Key Features

- Text entry and editing
- File operations (open, save, close)
- Basic editing operations (cut, copy, paste)
- Search and replace functionality
- Syntax highlighting (for code)
- Line numbering

## Preparation Steps

1. **Define Requirements**
   - Identify target users
   - List essential features
   - Determine supported file formats

2. **Design Phase**
   - Create mockups of the user interface
   - Plan the application architecture
   - Select appropriate data structures for text handling

3. **Technology Stack Selection**
   - Choose programming language (Python, Java, C++, etc.)
   - Select UI framework/library (Qt, GTK, JavaFX, etc.)
   - Determine platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

4. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Install required programming language
   - Set up IDE or code editor
   - Configure version control system

5. **Implementation Plan**
   - Create basic UI layout
   - Implement core text editing functionality
   - Add file operations
   - Integrate additional features

## Next Steps

- Break down implementation into sprints
- Create test cases for each feature
- Consider extensibility through plugins or scripting support
